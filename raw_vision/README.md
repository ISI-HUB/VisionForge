🚗 Edge Detection for Road Lane Detection

#Edge Detection
Edge detection is a process that identifies and locates sharp discontinuities in an image. Some techniques for edge detection include: 
Sobel edge detection
A widely used technique that computes a 2-D spatial gradient to identify edges. It's efficient, but sensitive to noise. 
Prewitt edge detection
Similar to the Sobel operator, but it doesn't emphasize pixels closer to the center of the mask. 
Gradient-based edge detection
Uses the first-order derivatives of the image intensity to measure changes in pixel values. The gradient magnitude and direction indicate the strength and orientation of the edges. 
Laplacian operator
Computes the second derivative of intensity to highlight regions where the intensity changes rapidly. 
Edge detection allows users to observe the features of an image for a significant change in the gray level. It reduces the amount of data in an image.
